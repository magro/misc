This project is used to demonstrate an issue with the testing of a page that uses a custom WebRequestCodingStrategy (using WicketTester). When the app is run in tomcat/jetty, it behaves as expected.

First checkout the project with
$ git clone git://github.com/magro/misc.git test
$ cd test/wicket-tester-custom-coding-strategy

Run application (works):
  - run
    $ mvn jetty:run
  - open your browser at
    http://localhost:8080/wicket-tester-custom-coding-strategy/Cadillac-m1.html
  - buy the Cadillac via submitting "Buy now!"
  - the (stateless) form is submitted,
    - the cadillac is added to the basket
    - and is shown in the list of items after the redirect
    - we're again at http://localhost:8080/wicket-tester-custom-coding-strategy/Cadillac-m1.html

Run test (fails):
  - run
    $ mvn test -Dtest=TestDetailsPage
